## About The Project

Laragram is an application i did for my university. The initial commit represents the base state of the app, which was graded. The application includes a basic CRUD for users, posts, likes and comments. Along with relationships that are needed for them. The app also includes vue.js and asynchronous communication with the app through axios. List of features include: 

1 Users  
2 Posts  
3 Image Upload  
4 Commenting on posts  
5 Liking Posts  
6 Asynchronous communication on places where it's needed  

## 1. Users

This uses Laravels built in auth for basic operations such as logging in and registering. Appart from that, users have roles and relationships with Posts, Comments, Likes and Images, which implement [Spatie Media Library](https://spatie.be/).  

- One user can have many posts, many comments, may like a comment or a post, and can have one profile image.  
- It is possible for users to pull out user specific posts (as shown in user dashboard where users can see their own posts)  
- Users can also edit posts and comments that are only theirs as well as delete them. They cannot do this to other users
- Admin has full rights to all user created features and can see everything going on in the application
